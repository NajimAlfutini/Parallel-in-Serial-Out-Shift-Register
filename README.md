# Parallel-in-Serial-Out Shift Register

## Objective
The goal of this project is to design and implement a digital circuit capable of identifying the top 10 highest numbers from a serial input stream. The results are then stored in a designated output file for further analysis or display.

## Project Overview
Utilizing the robust VHDL language and leveraging the power of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), this project introduces a sophisticated digital circuit. The core of the design is an array of Processing Elements (PEs) coupled with a parallel-in serial-out shift register, which together processes the incoming stream of numbers to extract the highest values efficiently.

## Implementation Details
- **Language Used:** VHDL
- **Software Used:** Quartus Prime 20.1

This system is particularly useful in applications where real-time data processing is crucial, such as in sensor data analysis or financial market monitoring. The use of FPGAs allows for high-speed data processing and the flexibility to reconfigure the circuitry as needed for different applications or updates to the algorithm.
